Death 2019 - 1Grid, sharehost don't understand that mysql compatible version with mysql that supports php5.0  mysql driver is required to run the site.
Cancelled hosting, everything went down hill after 1grid took over from webafrica.

2008 - re-factor everyting to be seperate from drupal for performance reason and the ability
to be index by google bots, included optermization for search engines.
This achived major performance agains, never again will write something in cms, it 
will always only just be the menus in the cms, the rest will be a stand alone system.

Fully automated, with some additional database optermization client side scripts.


See the perfanal_v2 folder, to understand how things work.
